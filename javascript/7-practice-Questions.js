 *   let avg = (hindi + eng + math) / 3

 * */ 

// answer to first question

let age = 23;
age +2; 
console.log(age) // 23; the result will remain the same becuse we are just adding 2 to the value 23 not assigning the calculated value to the age that's why the value of age remains the same;

// answer to 2nd  question.

let hindi = 80;
let english = 90;
let math  = 100;
let avg = (hindi + english + math) / 3  //(80+90+100)/3   = 270/3 = 90;
console.log(avg)

// so the average will be 90;
