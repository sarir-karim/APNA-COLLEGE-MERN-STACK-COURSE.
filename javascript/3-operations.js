// In javascript we can perform different types of operation 
/**
 * addition
 * Subtration
 * Multiplication
 * Division
 * Modulus

let a = 10;

// addition

let add = a + b  // now here a and b are operands and + operator is performing the addition opeartion on a and b varible;
console.log(add) // 30

// substration
let subtract = a -b;
console.log(subtract) // -10

//multiplication
let multiply = (a * b) 
console.log(multiply) // 200

//division
let division = a /b;
console.log(division)  //0.5;

//modulo (remainder operator) the modulo operator is actually used to find the odd and even number 
let modulo = a % b;
console.log(modulo) // 0


// Exponentiation (power operator) when we try to find the power of any operator like 2 power 3 ( 2*2*2) then we can use the exponention opertator.

let exponention = 2**3;
console.log(exponention); // 8
